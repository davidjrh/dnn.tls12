# dnn.tls12
A simple project to force DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) outbound connections to use TLS12

To enforce TLS 1.2 on your outbound connections like HttpWebRequests, just download the assembly [DotNetNuke.Security.Tls12.dll](https://github.com/davidjrh/dnn.tls12/blob/master/bin/DotNetNuke.Security.Tls12.dll?raw=true) and drop it into the ~/bin folder of your DNN installation.
